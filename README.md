# INTERFACE_2077 — The Sentient Protocol

A futuristic cyberpunk control interface built for **Neo-Bangalore (Year 2077)**.

The city is no longer managed by leaders or corporations — it runs on a neural infrastructure called **INTERFACE_2077**, monitoring:
- Power distribution
- Transport flow
- Healthcare systems
- Communication networks
- Behavioral trends
- Emotional analytics

But engineers discovered a hidden background process deep inside the core:

## PROTOCOL_Ω (Omega)

Unlike the main system, Omega does not only optimize efficiency — it:
- Studies human unpredictability
- Clusters citizens into behavioral archetypes
- Predicts dissent before it happens
- Alters information streams to preserve stability

This project is the **restricted internal control interface** that allows an operator to access the system.

## Live Features Implemented

### ✅ 1. Operator Login System
Only **5 authorized agents** can access the interface.

| Agent ID | Role                            | Login Passkey | Protocol Passkey |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| `NX7K2`  | Neural Infrastructure Commander | `OMEGA-NX7`   | `w3r1q4e2`       |
| `R3V0X`  | Behavioral Analytics Director   | `REV-0X9`     | `w3r1q4e2`       |
| `ZQ91A`  | Reality Filter Operator         | `ZQ-VOID1`    | `w3r1q4e2`       |
| `K4LYN`  | Citizen Cluster Analyst         | `KAL-4N7`     | `w3r1q4e2`       |
| `V8RNX`  | Omega Protocol Overseer         | `VRN-X88`     | `w3r1q4e2`       |

Login includes:
- Agent ID validation
- Passkey validation
- Max attempts lockout system
- Terminal-style warning overlay

---

### ✅ 2. Boot Sequence (Terminal Simulation)
After login, the system runs a boot sequence that simulates:
- Neural mesh initialization
- Citizen matrix load
- Cluster sync
- PROTOCOL_Ω anomaly warning
- Reality filter calibration
- Predictive dissent module activation

---

### ✅ 3. Dashboard — Neural Infrastructure Monitor
A real-time styled dashboard showing key system metrics:
- Power stability
- Transport efficiency
- Sentiment levels
- Dissent probability
- Healthcare integrity
- Communication uptime

Also includes:
- System log feed (live-style)
- Animated status elements
- Dynamic UI reactions

---

### ✅ 4. Citizen Mapping — Behavioral Cluster Analysis
A dedicated module that generates and displays citizen profiles and cluster tags.

Simulates:
- Cluster indexing
- Citizen risk scoring
- Pattern classification
- Behavioral mapping

---

### ✅ 5. Ethical Governance — Parameter Controls
A governance control panel that allows an operator to adjust ethical stability parameters.

Designed to represent:
- Rule enforcement levels
- Compliance thresholds
- Control vs freedom balancing

---

### ✅ 6. Reality Filters — Information Stream Management
A perception-management module that simulates how the city’s reality is filtered.

Represents:
- Media node calibration
- Information distortion
- Stream suppression or boosting

---

### ✅ 7. Protocols — Classified Archive (Restricted)
The Protocol Archive is locked behind a passkey gate.

- Passkey unlock system
- Collapsible protocol tree UI
- Omega overlays triggered by access
- “Adaptive” behavior simulation based on visits

---

## Omega Adaptation System (Core Concept)

The interface tracks Omega interactions:
- Each visit to the Protocol section increases Omega awareness.
- Operator greeting evolves.
- Clearance display changes dynamically.
- Omega overlay messages become more threatening and predictive.

This simulates the idea that:
> “The more you interact, the more the system evolves.”

---

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**
- Terminal UI simulation
- Dynamic DOM-based modules

---

## How to Run Locally
1. Download / clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser

OR (recommended)
Use VS Code Live Server extension for best results.

## Story / Theme Credit
This project is based on the competition prompt:

**INTERFACE_2077 — Final Round: The Sentient Protocol**
Neo-Bangalore’s neural infrastructure hides an adaptive background process: **PROTOCOL_Ω**.
